I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/) at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Haris Vikalo](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~hvikalo/). I am also a member of the [WNCG](https://wncg.org/) lab (**W**ireless **N**etworking and **C**ommunications **G**roup). My email is huanchengch [at] utexas.edu.

My research focuses on **Federated Learning** and **Trustworthy Machine Learning** in particular. Specifically, I am interested in:

**1)** federated learning with data-heterogeneous and resource-heterogeneous clients; 

**2)** model compression (pruning, quantization, distillation) in federated learning. 

**3)** I am also interested in differential privacy and adversarial robustness in federated learning. 

**4)** Recently, I start to work on Diffusion models.

Before joining UT Austin, I obtained my B.Eng degree from the department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).

Outside research，I am an electric guitar player (a fan of Pink Floyd), WOWer (for the alliance) and soccer player (a fan of Chelsea).
