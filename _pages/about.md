I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/) at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), advised by [Haris Vikalo](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~hvikalo/). I am also a member of the [WNCG](https://wncg.org/) lab (**W**ireless **N**etworking and **C**ommunications **G**roup). My email is huanchengch [at] utexas.edu.

My research focuses on Federated Learning and Reinforcement Learning in particular. Specifically, I am interested in 1) federated learning with data-heterogeneous and resource-heterogeneous clients 2) using reinforcement learning to improve client selection among millions of various clients in a realistic system. I am also interested in application of differential privacy in federated learning.

Before joining UT Austin, I obtained my B.Eng degree from the department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).

Outside research，I am an electric guitar player (a fan of Pink Floyd), WOWer (for the alliance) and soccer player (a fan of Chelsea).
